# Plasma cash history SNARK

Compacts history in Plasma Cashes by hiding Merkle proofs under the private witness. Currently contains only non-inclusion circuit, with inclusion being trivially extended.

Without much optimization is requires 4270718 constraints for 128 block of non-inclusion for 24 tree depth.

Public inputs to the zkSNARK:

- Start of the interval index (if single coin - just index)
- Interval length (is single coin - 1)
- Set of roots for which this coin index is proved to be non-included

## Run

Dummy tree and proof are generated for a large set of blocks
```
cargo run --release --bin benchmark_proof_gen
```
